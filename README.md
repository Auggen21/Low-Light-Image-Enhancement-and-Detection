# Low-Light-Image-Enhancement-and-Vehicle-Detection




Low-light image enhancement speciﬁcally addresses images captured in lowlight conditions such as nighttime, where the common goal is to brighten and improve the contrast of the image for better visual quality and show details that were hidden in darkness.Low-light is a challenging environment for image processing and computer vision tasks, either in contrast enhancement for better visibility and quality, or application oriented tasks such as detection. The scope of the proposed system is to develop android application that receives an image as an input, process it and output will display through the application interface. In the processing stage, system will enhance the low light image and detect the traﬃc participants in the image that will help the driver of the vehicle also advanced driving assistant system(ADAS). This system will help users to improve the quality of images and to detect each object in the image clearly.
